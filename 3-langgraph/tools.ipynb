    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated various types of tools in LangChain:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre-built tools** like Wikipedia, YouTube Search, and Tavily Search\n",
    "2. **Custom tools** created with the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tools extend the capabilities of LangChain agents by providing access to external APIs and services\n",
    "- Pre-built tools are ready to use with minimal configuration\n",
    "- Custom tools can be created from any Python function using the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "- Tools have standardized properties (`name`, `description`, `args`) that help agents understand how to use them\n",
    "- Proper documentation in tool docstrings is crucial for agent understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine multiple tools in LangGraph workflows\n",
    "- Create more sophisticated custom tools\n",
    "- Use tools with different LangChain agents and chains"
